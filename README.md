How to use the code
This module provides a function getPositionTextInput that takes text input commands from the user to control the position in a 3D space.

The user can type in 'forward', 'backward', 'left', 'right', 'up', 'down', 'location' or 'reset' to change the position. The current position is logged in the console after each command. The user can type 'exit' to stop.
